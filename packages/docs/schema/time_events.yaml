title: Time Events
type: object
description: |-
  Time events are the main data of the system. They are used to track the time of users to current event.

  Concerns:

  - Smart calculation for time between dates;
  - Capability to track if an event can be deleted or updated.

  Requirements:

  - When inserted time tracked must be separated by day, month, year, hour and minute;
  - The deletable and updatable fields are used to control if an event can be deleted or updated;
  - The type of event has four possible values: `arrive`, `break`, `return` and `exit`;
  - Each type has it own rules.
